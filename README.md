# Closing the Gap: Predicting Question Closure on Stack Overflow

I had taken a bootcamp on python. This was the final project which was to be submitted for completion of the bootcamp during the summers of 2021. 

The data-set is available on their github site. 

Link: [Training-set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/tax_payers/train_set_label.csv) and [Testing-set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/tax_payers/test_set_label.csv)


## Features

- Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to inform precise model selection
- Employed a diverse set of ML algorithms (logistic regression, SVM, KNN, Decision tree, random forest, MLP) and fine-tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, resulting in optimized political party preference predictions.
- Demonstrated expertise in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and result interpretation, leading to successful implementation of robust ML solution for predicting political affiliations based on socio-economic factors
